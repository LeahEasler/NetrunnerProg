In order to track money and turn clicks I wanted to design a program that automates this. 
Or at least help track with turn order.

Corpo
    3 clicks
    Draws card start of turn
    Starts with 5 creds
Runner
    4 clicks
    Does not draw cards
    Starts with 5 creds

Corpo
Creds []

[Corpo Clicks]/[Runner Clicks]

Runner
Creds []
+/-

Extra ideas:
Corpo display DRAW CARD BEFORE TURN STARTS
Corpo display Run last turn?
Runner [during run]
Runner damage tracker
